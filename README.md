# PHP classes with simple manipulation methods

## Installation
Install the package using composer.
```
composer require rudymas/manipulator
```

## Usage example
This part will be added at a later date.

## Future of this class
This package will eventually contain different classes that manipulate a certain element (Text, Number, ...)  
I only recently started this, so it is a work in process.
